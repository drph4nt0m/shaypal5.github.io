**Work**: Since early 2016 I have been working as a data scientist at [Neura].

**Education**: I finishing my Msc in computer science at The Hebrew University in Jerusalem. My research interests include machine learning, NLP, dynamic network processes, block chain systems and other areas in both data science and game theory.

**DataHack**: I co-founded and manage [DataHack][DataHack] - a yearly data science and machine learning hackathon (Israel's largest hackathon dedicated to these subjects). See more at the [Projects][Projects] page.

**Open source code**: On my spare time I have been creating some small open source tools. See more at the [Projects][Projects] page.
